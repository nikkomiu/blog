These are my notes of useful things that are worth knowing but not necessarily remembering from TryHackMe. They more or
less serve as a reference for me to look back on when I need to.

For this, I'm using Kali Linux as my OS, and I'm using the OpenVPN connection to connect to the TryHackMe network
instead of using their "AttackBox" machine.
